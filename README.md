# RPi4 Communications Lab

This repository is my personal lab for Raspberry Pi 4 communications.

Goals:
- Enable and test all main interfaces:
  - I2C, SPI, UART, CAN (MCP2515), RS485, GPIO
- Keep working test scripts for each interface
- Store notes, configs, and links/datasheets
- Make it easy to bring up a fresh Pi and verify all comms step by step
